# Office Printer Troubleshooting Guide

## Standard Office Printer: Xerox AltaLink C8055

## Issue 1: Printer shows "Offline" on Computer
1. **Check Power**: Ensure the printer's screen is on. If black, press the Power button.
2. **Network Check**: Ensure the printer is connected to the 'ACME-Devices' Wi-Fi or local ethernet.
3. **Queue Reset**: On your computer, open 'Printers & Scanners', select the Xerox printer, and click 'Open Print Queue'. Delete any stuck jobs and restart the printer.

## Issue 2: Paper Jam
1. Follow the on-screen instructions on the printer's LCD. It will specifically show where the jam is (Door A, Tray 2, etc.).
2. Open the indicated door gently and remove the jammed paper with both hands.
3. Close the door firmly.

## Issue 3: Low Toner/Ink
- The IT team is automatically notified when toner reaching 10%. 
- If you notice poor print quality, submit a ticket in Slack with the Printer ID (found on the sticker on the front).

## Adding a New Printer
- **macOS**: System Settings > Printers & Scanners > Add Printer. The printer should appear under 'Bonjour' if you are on the corporate Wi-Fi.
- **Windows**: Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers & scanners > Add device.
