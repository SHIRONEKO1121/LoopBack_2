# Software Troubleshooting & Security Deep Dive

## 1. Security Incidents (Immediate Response)
### Suspicious Activity on Laptop
1.  **Disconnect Network**: Turn off Wi-Fi immediately.
2.  **Report**: Call the Security Hotline at +1-888-IT-SECURE.
3.  **Audit**: Do NOT shut down the machine (this wipes the RAM where forensic evidence might reside). Close the lid and wait for an IT Security officer.

### Local Admin Rights
- **Tool**: We use **Privilege Manager** (by Thycotic) or **Admin by Request**.
- **Use Case**: Installing drivers, specialized dev tools.
- **Duration**: Approved for 30-minute windows. Requests must include the 'Vendor' and 'Business Reason'.

## 2. Common Application Faults

### Slack: "Cleared Cache & Restart"
- If images are not loading or messages are stuck:
  - **Mac/Win**: Help > Troubleshooting > Clear Cache and Restart.

### Google Chrome: "Managed by your organization"
- This is normal. It means Extension policies and security filters are applied. 
- **Troubleshooting**: If a site is blocked, check the 'Company Zscaler' app in your taskbar. Re-authenticate if it shows 'Logging In' for more than 5 minutes.

## 3. macOS Specific: "Zsh: command not found"
- This usually occurs after a macOS update because the `.zshrc` or `.zprofile` path was reset.
- **Standard Fix**: Run `source /etc/profile` and then re-append the IT path: `echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`.

## 4. Windows 11: "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD)
- **Top Cause**: Outdated Intel Graphics Drivers or CrowdStrike agent conflict.
- **Action**: Boot into Safe Mode. Run `C:\IT_Scripts\Update_Drivers.ps1`.
