# Meeting Room AV: Logitech Rally & Zoom Rooms Guide

## 1. Hardware Inventory (Standard Room)
- **Controller**: Logitech Tap (Touch Screen on table).
- **Camera**: Logitech Rally Bar (mounted under TV).
- **Audio**: 2x Mic Pods on table.
- **Compute**: Mac Mini M2 (mounted behind TV).

## 2. Common Failures & Quick Fixes

### "HDMI Not Detected" on Table Cable
- **Logic**: The HDMI signal goes through a Logitech Strong USB cable to the Bar.
- **Fix**: 
  1. Unplug the HDMI cable from the laptop.
  2. Locate the **Logitech Swytch** (purple cable) if available, and try that instead.
  3. Power cycle the Rally Bar by unplugging the power brick for 10 seconds.

### Camera is Flashing Red
- **Meaning**: The privacy shutter is stuck or there is a firmware update in progress.
- **Action**: Do NOT force the lens. Check the Logitech Sync app on the room PC to see if there is a pending update.

### Audio is Muffled/Echoing
- **Cause**: Usually caused by another laptop in the room being unmuted.
- **Fix**: Ensure ONLY the room system is using audio. All other participants must "Leave Computer Audio" in Zoom.

## 3. Advanced Connectivity: Wireless Sharing
- **Zoom Rooms**: Open the Zoom app on your laptop. Click 'Share Screen'. Enter the 6-digit Sharing Key displayed on the TV.
- **AirPlay**: Connect to 'ACME-Staff' Wi-Fi. Select 'Screen Mirroring' and choose the room name (e.g., 'Conf-Room-302').
